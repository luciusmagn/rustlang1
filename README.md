# Rust language examples
======================

This repository contains examples of the Rust language
written according to the Rust tutorial video by Derek
Banas. The code here is split to many files, one for
each topic and bundled together so that the can be ran
all at once with cargo

### Note
All the examples can be taken out, and ran separately,
but all xprintln! macros have to be replaced with regular
println! ones. The xprintln! macro just indents the output
before printing it.


### Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/luciusmagn/rustlang1.git
cd rustlang1
cargo run
```

As simple as that.
